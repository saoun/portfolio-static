        <p class="typewriter-text" data-text="Salam ya man.
          <br>
            I started working on this in April sometime, and I was getting it ready for your July birthday.
          <br>
            Then we broke up, as our story goes.
          <br>
            So I deleted this whole project, and picked it up again recently.
          <br>
            I know patience isn’t your forte, and unfortunately this little game might test it. But I believe in you, numbar wan. 
          <br>
          So let’s get started. To enter, you need a code. Our first date, in mmddyyyy format."></p>
        <p>Enter key:</p>
        <input id="masterKeyValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="masterKey()">Submit</button>
        <p id="demo"></p>
      </div>

      <div id="question1" style="display:none;">
        <p class="typewriter-text" id="paragraph1" data-text="I'm glad you remember.
        <br>
          Now, tell me. Shortly after, I wrote to you my first letter. 
        <br>
          In it, I asked you not to make something.
        <br>
          Of course, stubborn as you are, you did anyways. What was it?"></p>
        <input id="firstValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="question1()">Submit</button>
        <p id="demo1"></p>
      </div>

      <div id="question2" style="display:none;">
        <p class="typewriter-text" data-text="That's right :)
        <br>
          From our to-do list, we did everything except one thing. What did we miss?"></p>
        <input id="secondValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="question2()">Submit</button>
        <p id="demo2"></p>
      </div>

      <div id="question3" style="display:none;">
        <p class="typewriter-text" data-text="You so smart. Baby genius you.</p>
        <br>
          In my May 2022 letter, there was a reference to a certain form of Japanese art.
        <br>
          I often think about it when I think of our relationship.
        <br>
          We've been through a lot, in such a short time, and yet manage to repair and go through it together.
        <br>
          What's the name of this art?"></p>
        <input id="thirdValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="question3()">Submit</button>
        <p id="demo3"></p>
      </div>

      <div id="question4" style="display:none;">
        <p class="typewriter-text" data-text="Indeed! I knew you had to look this one up :)
        <br>
          I miss you, a lot. Most viscerally though, je veux dormir avec toi, __________:"></p>
        <input id="fourthValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="question4()">Submit</button>
        <p id="demo4"></p>
      </div>

      <div id="question5" style="display:none;">
        <p class="typewriter-text" data-text="I feel you next to me :)
        <br>
          Also,
        <br>
          I opened your head
        <br>
          To read your thoughts
        <br>
          I devoured your eyes
        <br>
          To taste your sights.
        <br>
        I drank your blood
        <br>
          To know your desire
        <br>
          And made of your shivering body"></p>
        <input id="fifthValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="question5()">Submit</button>
        <p id="demo5"></p>
      </div>

      <div id="question6" style="display:none;">
        <p class="typewriter-text" data-text="I know you are going through a hard time. But remember,
        <br>
          <em>'Let everything happen to you'</em>"></p>
        <input id="sixthValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="question6()">Submit</button>
        <p id="demo6"></p>
      </div>
      
      <div id="question7" style="display:none;">
        <p class="typewriter-text" data-text="<em>'Just keep going. No feeling is final.'</em>
        <br>
          We're almost there. Congrats on making it this far.
        <br>
         You have one more step before your final destination.
        <br>
         What is the most used adjective in our chat history?"></p>
        <input id="seventhValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="question7()">Submit</button>
        <p id="demo7"></p>
      </div>

      <div id="endText" style="display:none;">
        <p class="typewriter-text" data-text="Exactly :)
        <br>
          Well, unlike this adjective, I have quite a few, what should we call them, 'romantic' feelings for you. 
        <br>
          Loving you takes me to many different places in my mind, and so does music.
        <br>
          Hope you enjoy this journey:"></p>
