          <br>
            I started working on this in April sometime, and I was getting it ready for your July birthday.
          <br>
            Then we broke up, as our story goes.
          <br>
            So I deleted this whole project, and picked it up again recently.
          <br>
            I know patience isn’t your forte, and unfortunately this little game might test it. But I believe in you, numbar wan. 
          <br>
          So let’s get started. To enter, you need a code. Our first date, in mmddyyyy format."></p>
        <p>Enter key:</p>
        <input id="masterKeyValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="masterKey()">Submit</button>
        <p id="demo"></p>

      <div id="question1" style="display:none;">
        <p id="typewriter-text" data-text="I'm glad you remember."></p>
        <p><br>
          Now, tell me. Shortly after, I wrote to you my first letter. 
        <br>
          In it, I asked you not to make something.
        <br>
          Of course, stubborn as you are, you did anyways. What was it?"></p>
        <input id="firstValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="question1()">Submit</button>

      <div id="question2" style="display:none;">
        <p id="typewriter-text" data-text="That's right :)
        <br>
          From our to-do list, we did everything except one thing. What did we miss?"></p>
        <input id="secondValue">
        <br>
        <button class="test" type="button" onclick="question2()">Submit</button>

        <br>
          In my May 2022 letter, there was a reference to a certain form of Japanese art.
        <br>
          I often think about it when I think of our relationship.
        <br>
          We've been through a lot, in such a short time, and yet manage to repair and go through it together.
        <br>
          What's the name of this art?"></p>
        <input id="thirdValue">
        <br>

      <div id="question4" style="display:none;">
        <p id="typewriter-text" data-text="Indeed! I knew you had to look this one up :)
        <br>
          I miss you, a lot. Most viscerally though, je veux dormir avec toi, __________:"></p>

        <br>
          Also,</p>
        <br>
          I opened your head</p>
        <br>
          To read your thoughts</p>
        <br>
          I devoured your eyes</p>
        <br>
          To taste your sights.</p>
        <br>
        I drank your blood</p>
        <br>
          To know your desire</p>
        <br>
          And made of your shivering body"></p>

          Hope you liked the quote. It's one of my favorites.
        <br>
          Fantasy takes me to many different places in my mind, and so does music. <br><br>Hope you enjoy this journey:
